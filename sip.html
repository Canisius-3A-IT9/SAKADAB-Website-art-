		<h4>Background and Significance of the Study</h4>
			<img src="composting.jpg"><br>
			Composting is the natural process of turning organic waste, such as leaves and food scraps 
			into a fertilizer that improves soil and plants. Organic waste we produce at home can be recycled 
			with the help of composting. Since compost may act as substitute fertilizers, this can help cut costs. 
			This experiment aims to know if egg shells and banana peels  increase the growth rate of plants. 
			Based on research, egg shells and banana peels help in root growth in plants helping them to grow 
			faster and stronger.<br><br>
			SAKADAB mentions that they are financially unstable due to constantly relying on fluctuating sales 
			of their beneficiaries products and services. This experiment can greatly help them not only financially 
			but also food-wise. Egg shells and banana peels encourage root growth and increases the growth rate of plants 
			which makes it very suitable for growing vegetables and fruits which can help lessen food expenses. Tomatoes, 
			cabbages <br><br>
			<h4>Statement of the Problem and Hypothesis</h4>
			A. Does composting eggshells and banana peels increase the growth rate of green onions?<br><br>
			B. If we use the compost of eggshells and banana peels for green onions, then the growth rate is increased compared to using no compost.<br>
			<h4>Review of Related Literature</h4>
			Green onions are cheap and healthy onions easily available to everyone (Green Onions—One of the Most Affordable Superfoods! (n.d.).
			Becky Striepe from the care2 site went into detail about the health benefits of green onions. She states that green onions contain
			100 times more phytonutrients than other full-grown onions as well as containing compounds that
			support immune health, regulate blood sugar, are anti-inflammatory, prevents cancer and more.
			Green onions are also easy to grow, taking only 50-60 days until they're ready for harvest (Jabbour, 2022)
			SAKADAB is currently having financial problems while also serving PWDs, making their task hard.(Community Page GK SAKADAB, 2022)
			But since we believe that the properties of green onions listed above is very helpful,Green onions will help
			SAKADAB save money while also providing them with food and a new possible source of income. <br><br>
