		<i>"Women need make-up and fine clothes for two reasons: seduction and camouflage. With make-up, negative emotions like dread and insecurity are covered up, whereas emotions like feeling more attractive and confident are enhanced by nice clothes."</i><br><br> -Won Hwang

		<i>"Part of being human is wanting to have a good image and reputation in other people eyes. But the downside to this is that it can be very draining and tiring. The artist wants to visualize how much it can be stressful for a person to try to live up to societies standards of being a good person. As obviously seen in the person's expression, they are clearly tired of trying to fit in standards made by the society just so they be accepted into groups of people."</i><br><br> -Jamila Lampauog

		<i>"This artwork is based of Caravaggio's fruit basket painting. The artist added a modern touch by adding milk tea on the side. The artist wants to show that just like fruits, there are different varieties for one fruit. This can also be seen in types of people. And these varieties live on for a long time just like the original painting."</i><br><br> -Jamila Lampauog <br><br>

		<i>"Good and evil are uniquely human concepts that vary not only by culture and location, but also by individual. Nothing is inherently good or bad. We give these definitions and qualities to the world out of necessity, perhaps to make sense of it or organize it in a way our minds can comprehend."</i><br><br> -Won Hwang
